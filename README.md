# Nicholas Famoye
My name is Nicholas Famoye, i transitioned from a sociological background into technology as a Big Data Engineer. i enjoy analyzing and programming which promt my enthusiastic quest towards learning programing languages, frameworks and databases like Python, Scala, linux, SQL, MongoDB that can enhance my productivity in an effective and efficient way with an utmost desire to develop application and analyze big data to deduce meaningful information for real-time diagnostic, descriptive, predictive and prescriptive purposes.

# Project 1

## Automobile Sales Management Application
This is  my first interactive Back-end programming application project designed with the purpose of enhancing employee's productivity by conglomerating the application  with the database using PYMongo while ensuring easy user story interaction and CRUD operations features. It is written in Python and MongoDB was used for the database.
